# Step#1 Import Data-set to R

Student <- read.table("Assignment 6 Dataset-1 (1).txt",header=T,sep=",")
Student

# Create an altered list sorted on sex, with separate Grade means 

StudentAverage <- ddply(Student, "Sex", transform, Grade.Average=mean(Grade))
StudentAverage

# Write the new data set to a file

write.table(StudentAverage, "StudentAverage")

# Step#2 Convert the data set to a dataframe for names whos' name contains the letter i

i_students <- subset(Student, grepl("i", Student$Name, ignore.case=T))
i_students

# Step#3 Write the filtered data set and convert it to CSV file

write.table(i_students, "DataSet.csv", sep=",")
